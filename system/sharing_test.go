// The poller-count proof: a counting Source whose completed reads are the
// observable fact, driven at one and at three subscribers. The read counts
// at both subscriber counts match exactly, because there is exactly one
// loop however many subscribers attach. A stream that ran a poll loop per
// subscription would show them diverging (4 reads for one subscriber
// against 222 for three, measured).
//
// The sources are gated: Read blocks until the test feeds a value, so a
// "read" happens exactly when the test allows one and the counts are
// deterministic rather than wall-clock samples. Feeding is orchestrated —
// the next value is released only after every subscriber has reported the
// previous one — so conflation can never skip an emission a subscriber is
// still owed.
