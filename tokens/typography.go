	// the same size at any line height at all, and wrapped text lands one

	// Zero means "no line height" and leaves the shaper's own default in

	// A Typography travels by value: every component in this organization

	// a shaper. A cache held in the struct itself is therefore written into a
	// local that dies at the end of the map function, and the next emission
	// rebuilds it. Behind a pointer the cache belongs to the value's *source*,
	// so rx.Of(DefaultTypography) builds one shaper for the process rather
	// than one per emission, per component, per theme change.
	//
	// WithFaces allocates a fresh cache, because a different collection is a
	// different shaper. A Typography built as a bare composite literal rather
	// than derived from DefaultTypography has no cache until its first shaper
	// call allocates one, which for a value that is copied before that call
	// degrades to the per-copy behaviour this field exists to end. Derive from

// Shaper returns the shaper applications should draw with: Faces first, then
// the platform's own fonts for anything Faces cannot serve. It is built on the
// first call and cached, and every copy of the value it was built through —
// including every copy an rx emission makes — hands back that same shaper.
//
// The fallback is the point. Faces is Roboto and Roboto Mono, which between
// them carry no arrow, no box-drawing character and no dingbat, so a shaper
// confined to them draws a missing-glyph box — tofu — for text a real
// application genuinely receives. Leaving the system fonts on means text
// resolves: all of it, including the glyphs no embedded face was ever going to
// have.
//
// What the platform serves therefore varies by machine, which is exactly why
// tests must not use this one. See DeterministicShaper.
//
// # One shaper, one goroutine
//
// The shaper handed back is shared, and it is not safe for concurrent use.
// gioui.org/text says so itself: the same Shaper must not be used from
// different goroutines, and it panics on its internal map when it is. An
// earlier version of this comment promised the exact opposite — "safe for
// concurrent use from any number of goroutines" — and the per-copy cache that
// promise was written to justify is what stopped the cache from ever being
// read back.
//
// Sharing one shaper is nevertheless right, because Gio renders on a single
// goroutine. The rx observables in this organization paint nothing: they
// assemble a forest of widgets that the frame event handler then lays out, on
// that one goroutine. A shaper therefore does not need to be per-value, per
// component or per emission — one shaper per face collection is what the
// toolkit expects, and the only arrangement that does not re-parse sixteen
// embedded faces and re-enumerate the platform's fonts on every theme change.
//
// The rule that follows is short: call Shaper from the goroutine that runs the
// event loop and do not hand the result to another one. Copying the Typography
// does not buy you a second shaper. Use WithFaces, which allocates a fresh
// cache along with its wider collection.

// DeterministicShaper returns the shaper golden tests must draw with: Faces
// and nothing else, system fonts off, so that the same text shapes to the same

// from Shaper's, in the same cache every copy of the value shares. The
// single-goroutine rule under Shaper applies here too, and for the same reason.
//
// A test that pins its faces this way says what it wants, which is stricter
// than inheriting a default — it cannot drift when the default changes, and it
// cannot pass here and fail on a machine with a different font set.
//
// The pinning is real: a rune outside Faces shapes to the missing-glyph glyph
// rather than to whatever the machine happens to own. A test that legitimately
// draws such a rune adds the face that carries it instead of reaching for the
// platform's:
//
//	typ := tokens.DefaultTypography.WithFaces(notosansmono.FontFace())
//	shaper := typ.DeterministicShaper()
//
// That keeps the test deterministic without making it blind. It does not make
// symbols acceptable in a golden image: the face serving a symbol is the
// machine-dependent thing goldens exist to avoid, so symbol coverage is
// asserted at the glyph level — the shaper resolved this rune to a real face —

// It is the one line an application adds a face with, rather than rebuilding
// the collection by hand:
//
//	typ := tokens.DefaultTypography.WithFaces(notosansmono.FontFace())

// Two callers want this. An application that cannot rely on system fonts — a
// container, a kiosk, anything shipping its own world — appends the optional
// symbol face, since the fallback Shaper counts on is not there to be had. And
// a test appends whatever face its subject legitimately draws from, then pins
// it with DeterministicShaper.
//
// The extra faces go last, so they serve as fallback without displacing the
// default family: text naming no typeface still resolves to Faces[0]'s.
//
// WithFaces is also the only supported way to get a second shaper out of this
// type. Copying a Typography no longer detaches its cache — that is the point
// of F5.1 — so a copy that must shape from a different collection has to say
