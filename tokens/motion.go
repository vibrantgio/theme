// MD3's "full" emphasized ease is a two-segment path (an accelerate
// segment chained into a decelerate one) that a single cubic-bezier cannot
// represent. EaseEmphasized carries the documented single-bezier stand-in,
// which is material-web's own easing-emphasized value: the standard curve
// (0.2, 0, 0, 1). That is an honest approximation, not the spec path —
// the expressive character lives in the accelerate/decelerate pair, which
// single beziers do represent exactly.
//
// Durations. MD3 publishes sixteen duration roles — short1-4 (50-200 ms),
// medium1-4 (250-400), long1-4 (450-600), extra-long1-4 (700-1000), same
// source as above. Desktop keeps the five existing stops rather than
// adopting all sixteen: a pointer-driven desktop app wants fewer, faster
// stops (ADR-005's reading), and five is what every consumer already
// works from. Each stop is defined as exactly one MD3 role:
//
//	stop       was     MD3 role   now     used for
//	----       ---     --------   ---     --------
//	DurXFast   75 ms   short1     50 ms   state layers, hover feedback
//	DurFast    150 ms  short3     150 ms  small component transitions
//	DurNormal  250 ms  medium1    250 ms  standard enter/transition
//	DurSlow    400 ms  medium4    400 ms  emphasized/large transitions, fades
//	DurXSlow   500 ms  long2      500 ms  the slowest desktop motion; delays
//
// The reasoning: the three middle stops already sat on MD3 role values and
// do not move. DurXFast drops 75 → 50 (short1) because instant-feeling
// pointer feedback is the faster lean the desktop cut exists for. DurXSlow
// drops 700 → 500 (long2): the extra-long family (700-1000 ms) is
// full-screen, touch-scale choreography that a desktop window never needs,
// so the scale's ceiling is long2 — which is also exactly the 500 ms
// tooltip delay and the 30-frame (500 ms at 60 Hz) effects/motion default
// already shipping, so the ceiling change costs no consumer a behaviour
// change.
//
// Springs. The effects physics path animates with damped springs rather than
// beziers, so the scale carries spring presets alongside the curves. FX.2
// (the effects/spring defaults fix) is not landed as of 2026-08-05 and owns
// the decision of what a usable default is; per that coordination these
// presets encode effects' CURRENT working values rather than pre-empting
// FX.2 — it may retune them when it lands:
//
//	preset         mass  stiffness  damping        source
//	------         ----  ---------  -------        ------
//	SpringDefault  1     80         2·√80  ≈17.9   effects/motion DefaultSpring (critical)
//	SpringSnappy   1     300        22     ζ≈0.64  effects/springbutton defaults (slight overshoot, "pop")
//	SpringGentle   1     20         2·√20  ≈8.94   effects/spring doc example (critical, soft)
//
// effects/spring's own zero-Options fallback (k=0.4, c=0.7 — the ~873-frame
// settle FX.2 exists to fix) is deliberately NOT a preset.

// Reduced returns the reduce-motion variant of the scale: every duration
// stop is zero, everything else — easings and spring presets — is carried
// unchanged. It is what the theme's Motion field emits while the OS
// "Reduce Motion" preference is on (E3.2).
//
// Zero durations are the whole contract. A duration-driven animation of
// zero duration is complete the moment it starts — effects/motion's
// FramesAt(0, fps) is 0 frames — so a component that derives its frame
// count from the scale reaches its target on the first frame it draws:
// it snaps. (Watch one pulse edge: effects/motion's Options treats a zero
// Frames as "use the default", so a caller that snaps must skip the
// primitive on a zero duration rather than construct one with Frames 0.)
//
// The spring presets are deliberately NOT retuned. No finite spring
// completes in one frame, and a stiffness large enough to fake it
// (ω ≈ 600 rad/s for a 16 ms settle) is far outside the stability range
// of effects/spring's explicit integrator at 60 Hz — it would oscillate or
// diverge, the opposite of reduced motion. A spring-driven component
// honours reduce-motion the same way a duration-driven one does: it reads
// the zero durations as the signal and jumps to its target instead of
// animating.
