// Seed-derived palettes. FromSeed turns one brand colour into ADR-007's
// complete paired light and dark ramp sets, and DefaultLight/DefaultDark
// are FromSeed of the default seed.
//
// Derivation rules, and where each comes from:
//
//   - The shared lightness scale is ADR-007's: CIELAB L* per step, measured
//     by the D0.1 spike from the Claude Design reference project's own
//     ramps. Light 100–900 = 97, 92, 85, 74, 63, 51, 39, 28, 6 — the
//     measured 900 was L* 18, but D2.4's APCA gate deepened it: APCA's soft
//     black clamp caps even pure black near Lc 92 over the L* 92 step-200
//     ground, so Lc ≥ 90 needs the 900 stop at L* 6 (min Lc 90.7 across the
//     seven default ramps; L* 18 measured Lc 85–87). The dark scale is the
//     paired scale measured from the same source's dark column (ADR-007's
//     evidence table): 8, 13, 19, 30, 65, —, 82, —, 94; the 600 and 800
//     stops the table has no surface for are interpolated to 74 and 88 (the
//     dark 900 already clears the gate at Lc 93–96, so it is untouched).
//     Both scales are swept at constant OKLCh hue and chroma via
//     color.Tone, which gamut-maps by chroma reduction (ADR-002).
//
//   - Accent hues and chromas follow MD3's material-color-utilities
//     conventions, which ADR-007 does not supersede, converted into the
//     OKLCh chroma axis. The conversion anchor: the canonical seed #6750A4
//     has HCT chroma 48 and measures OKLCh chroma 0.1305, so one HCT chroma
//     unit ≈ 0.00272 OKLCh chroma. Neutral = seed hue at chroma 0.010
//     (MD3's neutral 4; ADR-007's measured reference columns sit at
//     0.009–0.011). Secondary = seed hue at chroma 0.044 (MD3's 16).
//     Tertiary = seed hue +60° at chroma 0.065 (MD3's 24). Primary uses the
//     seed's measured hue and chroma unchanged.
//
//   - The three status roles are hue-fixed, not seed-derived. A semantic
//     colour must not rotate with the brand: a purple "success" says
//     nothing. Each takes the OKLCh hue and chroma of a canonical Material
//     colour, measured with this module's own converters and recorded here
//     (measurements from F4.6; the error pair predates it, from D2.2):
//
//       error    hue  28.7°, chroma 0.178  — MD3's canonical error base
//                                            #B3261E (its "hue 25,
//                                            chroma 84"), L* 39.7
//       success  hue 144.2°, chroma 0.162  — Material Green 500 #4CAF50,
//                                            L* 63.98
//       warning  hue  84.9°, chroma 0.172  — Material Amber 500 #FFC107,
//                                            L* 81.52
//
//     The palette anchor of each family is its 500 shade, so that is what
//     is measured; only the hue and chroma are taken, since the depths come
//     from the shared lightness scale like every other role. The three land
//     56–59° apart on the OKLCh hue circle — far enough that warning is not
//     read as error at a glance, which is the whole point of a status
//     colour.
//
//   - Pins. The light primary base is the seed byte-for-byte (ADR-007:
//     "the seed sits deep, so bases are pins" — reading it off the ramp
//     would lighten it); only its alpha is forced opaque. The other light
//     bases are their role's hue and chroma at tone 40, the depth MD3 pins
//     accent bases at and the depth the default seed itself sits at
//     (L* 40.08). Dark bases are the same hue and chroma re-toned to L* 82
//     — the dark scale's step-700 depth, right beside MD3's dark
//     accent-base tone 80, making the dark pin byte-identical to its ramp's
//     step 700. The D0.1 spike sat them at L* 65, the step-500 depth
//     reproducing ADR-007's recorded dark fill #a690ea, but D2.4's APCA
//     gate showed an L* 65 mid-tone is a ground no text can reach Lc 60
//     over (black tops out near Lc 52, white near 57), so the pins moved up
//     two rungs — the default seed's dark primary is now #d0c4ff — and the
//     solid state walk still lands on exact rungs (hover 800, pressed 900).
//
//   - The inverse pair. Each scheme's InverseSurface and OnInverseSurface
//     are the *other* scheme's Surface and Text — its neutral ramp's steps
//     200 and 900 — so a light scheme's inverse chip is dark and a dark
//     scheme's is light, and the pair's separation is the counterpart
//     scheme's own body-text separation rather than a second measurement
//     (WCAG 13.75:1 light, 15.06:1 dark on the default seed; the
//     high-contrast variant widens both to 15.99:1 and 17.11:1 by
//     deepening the 900 stop the on-colour reads off). Both
//     schemes are derived in one pass here, so neither needs anything the
//     other has not already computed.
//
//   - On-colours. Light bases sit at tone 40, so their on-colour is White
//     (Lc ≥ 85, WCAG ≈ 6.4:1); dark bases sit at L* 82, so their on-colour
//     is their own dark ramp's step 100 (Lc ≥ 73, WCAG ≈ 11:1). D2.4's
//     APCA gate enforces ADR-007's Lc ≥ 60 on both.
//
// FromSeedHighContrast (task E3.3) derives the increased-contrast variant
// from the same seed by the same machinery — it is a FromSeed option, not a
// third hand-written scheme. Three widenings, each computed against the
// APCA gate rather than guessed:
//
//   - The 700 text step deepens to the default scale's 900 depth in both
//     modes — light 700 L* 39 → 6, dark 700 L* 82 → 94 — so 700 text meets
//     the same Lc ≥ 90 bar the default asks only of 900 (light min Lc 90.7,
//     dark 93.0 across the seven ramps; APCA's soft black clamp caps lighter
//     choices below 90, the same wall D2.4 hit). The 800 and 900 stops
//     slide outward — light 3 and 0, dark 97 and 100 — keeping the ladder
//     strictly monotonic and the 900 gate clear with margin (light Lc 92.3,
//     dark 104.4). Steps 100–600 are the default scale unchanged: the
//     grounds stay, the text pulls away.
//
//   - Divider resolves from Neutral step 500 instead of 300: the separator
//     jumps from the subtle-border rung to ADR-007's strong-border rung.
//
//   - Each pinned base's on-colour is pushed further from its base. The
//     dark pins' on-colours drop from their ramp's step 100 (L* 8, Lc ≈ 74
//     — just under the variant's Lc ≥ 75 floor) to tone 0, the scale's
//     floor (Lc ≥ 76.3). The light pins keep White: it is already the far
//     end of the axis and already clears the floor (Lc ≥ 85.7), so the
//     pins do not move — the light primary base stays the seed
//     byte-for-byte, the same contract as FromSeed.
