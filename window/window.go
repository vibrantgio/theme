// Package window scopes a theme to a window. A [Window] is an [mvu.Window]
// plus the rx.Observable[theme.Theme] that drives what it renders, which is
// what lets two windows in one process show different themes at once —
// light and dark, brand A and brand B, one document's theme and another's.
//
// It is the application's entry point to the whole theme runtime, and
// three lines wide: build an mvu window, wrap it with a theme, render.
//
//	w := window.New(mvu.NewWindow(app.Title("Todos")), system.LiveTheme(time.Second))
//	err := w.Render(buildLayers(modelObs)).Wait()
//
// Below the window the theme contract is per component — every components
// component takes an rx.Observable[theme.Theme] — and [Window.Render]
// exists to hand that one observable to the builder that constructs them,
// so no application code threads it manually.
//
// Isolation is a property of the observables, not of this type. Two Windows
// given two different observables share nothing — including their OS poll
// loops, since each system.LiveTheme call builds its own. Two Windows given
// the same one still render independently, and since FX.5 they also share
// its poll loops: the theme streams are multicast, so however many windows
// and layers subscribe to one observable, each OS source is polled once per
// interval.
//
// [Window.Render] shadows the embedded [mvu.Window.Render] and takes a
// different argument: a build function, not layers. The embedded one is
// still reachable as w.Window.Render for a caller that has plain layers and
// no use for the theme, at the cost of the scoping this package exists for.
// Either way it runs until the window is destroyed and cannot be restarted
// — a second Render call on the same window is not supported; build a new
// window instead.
