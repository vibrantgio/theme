// tone for a tonal palette with OKLCh hue in degrees and OKLCh chroma.
// Tone is Material Design 3's tone axis — CIELAB L*, 0 exactly black to
// 100 exactly white — and MD3's thirteen standard stops are 0, 10, 20, 30,
// 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99 and 100, though any tone in [0,100] is
// valid; tones outside that range are clamped to it. Chroma is reduced
// toward 0 at constant tone and hue when the request does not fit sRGB,
// per NRGBAFromToneChromaHue, which this wraps.
