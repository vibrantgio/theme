// Package typeset lays a type role's text out in the line box that role names,
// rather than in the box its glyphs happen to ink.
//
// It exists because gioui.org's text layout and a design system's typography
// mean different things by "line height". [gioui.org/widget.Label] passes
// LineHeight to the shaper, and gioui.org/text's calculateYOffsets baselines
// the first line at that line's own ascent and spends the line height only on
// the gap to the next one. The consequence is exact and easy to miss: a label
// with MaxLines 1 — which nearly every control in this system is — reports the
// same size at any line height at all. Measured on prism/button's LabelLarge
// specimen at 14 dp: 17 px tall at line height 0, 20, 32 and 64 alike, and the
// rendered button byte-identical in all four.
//
// A design system means the CSS thing. `line-height: 20px` on a one-line
// button makes the line box 20 px tall whatever the glyphs measure, the extra
// space split half above and half below the ink, and that is what
// theme/export already writes into `--font-<role>-line-height` for the
// design-surface mirror to consume. Without this package the Gio rendering and
// the CSS it exports disagree about the same token.
//
// [Layout] is the fix, and it is a wrapper rather than a replacement: it lays
// the label out exactly as widget.Label would, then pads the result up to the
// line box and reports that. Callers keep MaxLines, Alignment, WrapPolicy and
// every other widget.Label field.
//
//	f := typeset.Font(style, font.Normal)
//	lbl := typeset.Label(style, 1)
//	dims := typeset.Layout(gtx, shaper, lbl, f, unit.Sp(style.Size), text, material)
//
// The correction is a deficit, not a floor, so it is right for wrapped text
// too: Gio already spends the line height on each gap, so adding the one
// missing line height gives n lines a box of exactly n × line height.
//
// The deficit is measured against the text being laid out, not against the
// face it names, because Gio takes a line's ascent as the maximum over that
// line's runs — a line holding a fallback run is taller than its primary face
// and needs less added, not the same. See [Layout].

// the whole line box, so a negative one baselines every line *above* the line
// before it and a wrapped label draws its lines on top of each other. There is

// Layout lays txt out as lbl would and returns it in its line box: the same
// pixels, in dimensions tall enough for the line height lbl carries, with the
// leading split evenly above and below the ink and the baseline moved to
// match.
//
// It is a no-op in two cases, and returns lbl.Layout's own result unchanged in
// both. An absolute line height smaller than the natural line of this text —
// an unset or negative one included — has no leading to distribute. And a
// label whose LineHeightScale is not 1 is asking for a height relative to the
// face's metrics, which the shaper already applies to every line including the
// first, so there is nothing missing to add.
//
// The extra height is a single deficit, added once, not once per line. Gio
// already spends the line height on the gap between lines, so the only line
// short of its box is the first: adding lineHeight − naturalLine to a run of n
// lines makes it exactly n × lineHeight tall. The half above is rounded down,
// which is what keeps a centred label pixel-identical to the uncorrected one
// whenever its container was already taller than the ink.
//
// # The natural line is this text's, not this face's
//
// naturalLine is measured from txt itself. Gio takes a line's ascent as the
// maximum over that line's runs, so a line carrying a fallback run — an arrow,
// a box-drawing character, anything the primary face has no glyph for — is
// taller than the primary face alone. Measuring a probe string instead made
// the deficit too large for exactly those lines: under the fallback shaper
// applications draw with, "arrows →←" came back 25 px tall where LabelLarge
// declares 20 and theme/export writes `line-height: 20`.
//
// # Constraints are applied once, to the corrected height
//
// widget.Label constrains its own result, so adding the deficit on top of that
// would double-count: a label handed Min.Y == Max.Y — which is every Flexed
// child of a vertical layout.Flex — would report more than its slot. Layout
// therefore lays out under a relaxed Min.Y, corrects, and constrains the
// corrected size once with the caller's own constraints. The result fits the
// constraints it was given, which is what every other Gio widget promises, and
// callers no longer have to zero Constraints.Min to be told the truth.

// It reads the number off two measurements of txt, because Gio spends an
// absolute line height only on the gaps between lines: laying n lines out at L
// gives naturalLine + (n−1)×L. Laying the same text out at a second, larger L′
// therefore moves the height by (n−1)×(L′−L) and nothing else — wrapping and
// truncation do not depend on the line height — so the gap count divides out
// and naturalLine falls out of the first measurement.
//
// The first measurement shapes the same text.Parameters the caller's own
// layout will, so it is a hit in the shaper's cache rather than a second
// shaping. The second is skipped whenever the text is known to be one line,
// which is the common case in this system: MaxLines 1, or a measurement that
// already fits inside a single box.
//
// Both measurements run with Min.Y dropped and Max.Y opened, so neither the
// caller's floor nor its viewport — which clips the glyphs widget.Label
// measures — can distort the answer. Max.X is left alone: it decides where the
// text wraps, and a measurement that wrapped differently would measure
// different text. The recorded ops are discarded.
